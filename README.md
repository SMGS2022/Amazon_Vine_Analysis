Analysis of Amazon reviews written by members of the paid Amazon Vine program

## Overview

The Amazon Vine program allows manufacturers and publishers to receive reviews for their products. Companies like SellBy pay a small fee to Amazon and provide products to Amazon Vine members, who then are required to publish a review. In using a cleaned data set, I  able to analyze the effects of the vine program in relation to star ratings.

## Results

• The data set I analyzed was (Home reviews) there are a total of 92,216 Vine and Non-vine reviewers.

• Vine and Non-vine reviewer 5-star ratings total 44,751.

• There are 647 Vine and 44,104 Non-vine 5-star ratings.

• Percentage of paid ratings is 0.7% while percentage of unpaid ratings is 47.8%.

• Non-vine reviews account for 46.3% of all 5-star reviews while paid reviews accounts for 57.1%.

## Summary

A positive bias for reviews goes towards the Vine program. Reviewers disproportionately give 5-star ratings (57.1% of vine reviewers are giving a 5-star rating as compared to 46.3% from Non-vine reviewers).
